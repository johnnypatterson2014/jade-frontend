Our goal is to be
able to calculate the derivatives of most of
the functions that we know. Let's start with
the simple ones. What are the simple ones? Constant functions, linear
functions, quadratics, polynomial functions, exponential and
logarithmic functions, and the trigonometric functions. You're going to be glad
to know that these have very nice and
simple derivatives. Let's start with lines. The simplest line is
actually a constant, so a horizontal line. This function is such that
the height at every point, for example, x_0 and
x_1 is always the same, some constant c. The
c could be -173.5, any number as long as
is always the same. Now let's look, for example, at the derivative at x_0. This tangent line has the same
slope as the entire line. What is the slope? Well, the slope is
Delta y over Delta x. Now the change in y is always zero because y is always c, so it's always c minus c. Therefore the
numerator
here is zero, and the denominator is not zero if we take x_0
different than x_1. So therefore, the
slope is always zero. We conclude that
a horizontal line or a constant always has
a derivative of zero. Now let's consider
some generic line that is not horizontal. It can have the equation
f of x equals a_x plus b, where a is the slope and
b is the y-intercept. What is the derivative
for this function? Well, this derivative
is very simple. Let's take a point,
for example, this one. We're going to
calculate it by taking any other point and
looking at Delta x, looking at Delta
y and calculating the slope Delta y over Delta x. Now this is rise over run, so it's going to be a,
which is the slope. Notice that as the second point is closer to the first one, well, the tangent stays
on the same slope for the same reason as what happened with
the constant line. When you have a line,
the tangent that every point has the same
slope as the entire line. This line has a slope of eight. Therefore, the equation
f of x equals a_x plus b of a line has a derivative
f prime of x of a. If you want to see
the math happening, well, let's look at the points. This point has equation x, ax plus b. Those are
the coordinates. This point has coordinates
x plus Delta x, a x plus Delta x b plus b. Therefore, when we
take the slope, it's Delta y over Delta x. That's the difference between this number and this
number, the Delta y. That's a_x plus Delta x
plus b minus a_x plus b. The denominator is Delta x. So a lot of things
cancel out here. This a _x cancels
out with this a_x. This b cancels out with this b, and then we have a times
Delta x over Delta x, the two delta x's cancel
out and the slope is a. Therefore, the
derivative of the line with equation a x plus
b is the slope a.

Now that you know lines,
let's take a look at a slightly more complicated
function, quadratics. The simplest quadratic
is this parabola with equation y
equals x squared. Let's look at the derivatives. Notice that to the
left of the y-axis, these are negative
and to the right of the y-axis, these are positive. The formula for the derivative
is Delta f over Delta x, as Delta x goes to 0. Now, Delta f is the change
in y or the change in f, which is x plus Delta x
squared minus x squared. Before we do this formally, let's take a look at an example. What happens when x equals 1, then
y is x squared,
which is also 1? Let's take a look
at some secants, calculate their
slope, and with that, we calculate the slope
of the tangent line. Let's start with a Delta x of 1. That means an interval of
length 1 horizontally. What is Delta f
when Delta x is 1? Well, it's the difference
between 4 and 1. 4 is 1 plus 1 squared
and 1 is 1 squared. This is 3 and what's the slope? Well, it's going to be 3
over 1 because Delta f is 3, Delta x is 1, and so 3 over 1 is 3, so the slope is 3. Now let's make the interval
smaller and see what happens. If we made this interval of
length 1 over 2 horizontally, then Delta x is 1 over 2. What is Delta y or Delta f? Well, it's going to be 1 plus 0.5
squared minus 1 squared, which is 2.25 minus 1, which is 1.25 and the slope
is 1.25 over one-half, and that is a value of 2.5. Now let's make an
interval even smaller. Let's make it a length
one-quarter horizontally. What is Delta f now? Well, Delta f is 1 plus 0.25
squared minus 1 squared, which is 0.56 and the
slope is 0.56 divided by one-quarter and that is 2.25. Now let's continue making
this interval smaller to see where the slope goes. It went from 3 to 2.5 to 2.25. Where do you think
it's going to go? Let's look at an interval
of length 1 over 8. The slope is going to be 2.125
and an interval of 1/16. The slope is 2.065.
Let's go extreme. Let's do an integral
of 1 over 1,000. The slope is going to be 2.001. It looks like the slope is going towards 2 and that's
actually the answer. The slope of the
tangent at 1 is 2. Notice that 2 is 2 times
one and that's actually the formula because the
derivative of x squared is 2x. Let's actually
calculate it formally. What's Delta f over Delta x? Well, Delta f, just like above, it's x plus Delta
x squared minus x squared divided by Delta x. Let's expand that and let's
cancel some things out. The x squared goes with
the minus x squared, the Delta x goes
with the delta x, and you get 2x plus Delta x. Now, what's the value
of 2x plus Delta x as Delta x goes to 0? Well, the 2x stays put
and this Delta x is 0. Therefore, the derivative df
over dx is going to be 2x. When f of x equals x squared, then the derivative is
f prime of x equals 2x.

Now that you know,
line some quadratics, let's go to cubics. The simplest cubic is the
function y equals x cubed, seen over here, and here are some of the
slopes of the tangents. Again, the formula is
very similar from before. It's x plus Delta x
cubed minus x cubed divided by Delta x. Then as delta x goes to zero, then this value becomes the slope of the tangent
line or the derivative. Let's do a small example
where x is equal to 0.5. When x is 0.5, then y is 1/8, because 1/2 cubed is 1/8. Let's take some intervals and calculate
the slope
of the secant lines. If Delta x is 1, then we have the point 3/2, which is 1/2 plus 1 and 27/8. Why 27/8? Because 1/2
plus 1
cubed is 27 or 8. We subtract 1/2 cubed
and we get 3.25. The slope of this
secant line is going to be 3.25 divide 1,
so that's 3.25. Now, let's decrease
the interval to length 1/2 and do the
same calculation. X plus Delta x cubed
is 1/2 plus 1/2 cubed, which is 1 minus 1/2 cubed, which is 1/8, so we
have 7/8 which is 0.86. The slope is 0.86
divided by 1/2, which is precisely 1.75. Now, let's go even smaller. Let's go for 1/4. I'll do the
calculations quickly, but I'd invite you to do them on pen and paper if you'd like. Delta f here is 0.3 and
the slope is 1.188. For 1/8, then Delta f is 0.12 and the slope is 0.12 divided by
1/8, which is 0.95. For 1/16, we have
a slope of 0.85. For 1/1000, we have
a slope of 0.752. As you see, this values
tend to converge to 0.75. That's actually the value
f prime of 0.5 is 0.75. That's actually 3
times 0.5 squared because the derivative of x
cubed is actually 3x squared. But let's actually calculate it formally to see
that this is the case. Delta f over Delta x
is going to be x plus Delta x cubed minus x
cubed as the change in y direction in the vertical direction
divided by Delta x, which is changed the
horizontal direction. Now expanding a cube is a little harder than
expanding a square, but this is what you get. If you cancel out the x cubed, if you divide top and
bottom by Delta x, then you get 3x Delta x plus 3x squared plus Delta x squared. Now, as Delta x goes to zero, what
happens with 3x Delta x plus 3x squared plus
Delta x squared? Well, anything that has
a Delta x becomes zero. The only thing that stays put is the 3x squared and
that's the derivative. If fx equals x cubed, then f prime of x equals 3x squared and that's the
derivative of this cubic.

Now that you know lines
and some polynomials, let's look at a
complicated one, 1/x. This is a hyperbola
that looks like this. Let's take a look at some
of the tangent lines. The function looks
more complicated, but actually the
calculation is quite simple for the
calculation when we do x plus Delta x inverse
minus x inverse divided by Delta x. Let's look at the point x
equals 1 and y equals 1. Let's take some interval
just like before. If the interval is of
length 1 horizontally, Delta x equals 1, then what is Delta f? Well, Delta f is going to be the change in the
vertical direction, so x plus Delta x inverse minus
x inverse for x equals 1. That means it's 1/2 minus 1. That's minus 0.5. The slope is minus
0.5 divided by 1, which means that the
slope here is minus 0.5. Now let's decrease the
length of the interval. Let's make it so
that Delta x is 1/2. If Delta x is 1/2, then what's delta f? Well, is 1 plus 1/2
inverse minus 1 inverse, which is 2/3 minus 1, which is minus 1/3. Delta x is simply
going to be 1/2. The slope is 0.33 divide by 0.5, which is minus
0.67 or minus 2/3. Now let's do some
more and again, I'll go a little faster
to the calculations. For 1/4, the slope is minus 0.8, for 1/8 is minus 0.89, for 1/16 is minus 0.94, and for 1/1000 it's
minus 0.999. As you can see, this
converges to minus 1. The derivative here is minus 1. This is negative 1
times 1 squared, which is actually the value. Because when f of x
equals x inverse, then the derivative is
minus 1x to the minus 2. Let's actually do the
calculation to confirm this. Delta f over Delta is going to be x plus Delta x
inverse minus x inverse divided by Delta x. Let's actually write this
as one over x plus Delta x minus 1 over x over Delta x. Let's expand the one on
the top as x minus Delta x plus x divided by x
plus Delta x times x. Some things cancel out, this plus x and this
minus x cancel out. We can multiply and
divide by Delta x and we get minus 1 over x
squared plus Delta x. Now as Delta x goes to 0, well, the one on top stays put, the x^2 stays put, but this goes to 0.
Therefore, we have 1
minus 1 over x squared. If f of x equals x inverse, then f prime of x equals minus
1 times x to the minus 2. Let's take a look at what
we've learned so far. The derivative of x squared, x cubed and x inverse, we've already calculated
the first one is 2x^1, the second one is 3x squared, and the third one is
minus 1x to the minus 2. Now, can you spot a pattern? These three actually follow
a really nice pattern. That works for any
power function. Take a look at the exponent. The exponent goes here in the derivative as a
multiplication factor. Then you subtract one from the exponent and you
get the new exponent. So x squared becomes
2x to the minus 1, x cubed becomes 3x
squared, and x inverse, so x to the minus 1 becomes
minus 1x to the minus 2. What do you think
happens with x^n? Well, with x to the n, the exponent of n
comes down and it becomes nx to the new
exponent is n minus 1, so nx^n minus 1. If you have any power function, for example, x^100, the
derivative is 100x^99. If it's x to the minus 100, the derivative is minus
100x to the minus 101.
