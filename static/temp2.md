To differentiate more complicated functions, we use four fundamental rules:
**scalar multiplication rule, sum rule, product rule, and chain rule.**

## 1. Scalar Multiplication Rule

If a function is multiplied by a constant:

"[f(x) = c \cdot g(x)\]"

then its derivative is:

"[f'(x) = c \cdot g'(x)\]"

**Why this works:**
Multiplying a function by a constant stretches it vertically. This multiplies every rise (vertical change) by c while the run (horizontal change) remains the same. Since slope = rise/run, all slopes — and therefore the derivative — are multiplied by c.

## 2. Sum Rule

If a function is the sum of two functions:

"[f(x) = g(x) + h(x)\]"

then

"[f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)\]"

**Intuition:**
Just as distances or velocities add, rates of change also add. If two quantities change over time and are added together, their total rate of change is the sum of their individual rates.

---

## 3. Product Rule

If a function is the product of two functions:

"[f(x) = g(x) \cdot h(x)\]"

then

"[f'(x) = g'(x)h(x) + g(x)h'(x)\]"

**Intuition:**
When both factors change, the total change comes from:

* The first changing while the second stays fixed
* The second changing while the first stays fixed

---

## 4. Chain Rule

If a function is a composition:

"[y = g(h(t))\]"

then

"[\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dg}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}\]"

In standard notation:

"[f(x) = g(h(x))\]"

then

"[f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x)\]"

**Intuition:**
A change in one variable causes a change in another, which causes a change in another. The total rate of change equals the product of the intermediate rates.

---

## Final Recap

* Scalar rule: multiply the derivative by the constant.
* Sum rule: derivative of a sum equals sum of derivatives.
* Product rule: differentiate one factor at a time and add.
* Chain rule: multiply the rates when functions are composed.

These four rules allow us to extend simple derivative formulas to much more complex functions.
